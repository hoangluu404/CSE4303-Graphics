Programming Assignment 02

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:

  * Demonstrate ability to write some simple C functions
      representing the some additional transforms.

  * Demonstrate again the ability to take a screenshot properly.
      (No, really;  for some persons, this is harder than it
       sounds. :)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Background:

  * All the math you need we reviewed in class.

  * Be certain you check for the error conditions we reviewed in
      class.  (These are mostly opportunities to divide by zero.)
      Just print a descriptive error message to stderr and then
      exit( 1 ).

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

  1. Download hmwk_02_dalioba.zip from Canvas.

  2. Unzip this files somewhere convenient.

  3. Change 'dalioba' in the name of the directory to your NetID.
     (Your NetID is three letters followed by four or five digits.
      The directory name will now be something like
      'hmwk_02_abc1234' but with _your_ NetID in place of
      'abc1234'.)

  4. Look in that directory.  There's a Template directory that
     has some files in it.  Move them up one level into the
     'hmwk_02_abc1234' directory.

  5. Change the header lines in the files transforms.c and
      IDTest2.c.

      -- Line 1:  Family name first, then a comma, then
                  personal name.

      -- Line 2:  Your NetID.

      -- Line 3:  The date you edited the file, in the format
                  YYYY-MM-DD (all digits!).

  6. Edit transforms.c and put the proper code in each of the
      bodies of the unwritten transforms -- there are four (4)
      spots you have to do this.  (They're marked with TODO
      comments.)

  7. After you're done with that, make and run transformsTest2.
      The complete results are shown in the file
      Results/transformsTest2Results.txt.  Your results should
      match EXACTLY.  If they don't, STOP RIGHT HERE and figure
      out what's wrong.  If this doesn't work perfectly, there's
      no point going any further.

  8. Make and run IDTest2.  The sample results are shown in the
      file Results/IDTest2Results.txt.  Your results should match
      EXACTLY.  If they don't, STOP RIGHT HERE and figure out
      what's wrong.  If this doesn't work perfectly, there's no
      point going any further.

  9. Now edit IDTest2.c so that it uses the digits from YOUR
      StudentID instead of the sample digits.  There are
      instructions in IDTest2.c explaining how to do this.  READ
      THE INSTRUCTIONS!  Remake and rerun the IDTest2 program and
      take a screenshot of it running with YOUR StudentID digits.

      The screenshot should be similar to the example in Results/
      though it will of course show the results using digits from
      YOUR StudentID.

      The screenshot MUST be in PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
      format.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Make a zipfile of your 'hmwk_02_abc1234' directory (with 'abc1234'
changed to YOUR NetID and with your transforms.c, IDTest2.c, and
IDTest2.png files in it) and submit this zipfile on Canvas as your
results for this assignment.

All your zipfile should include is a directory with three files in
it, transforms.c, IDTest2.c, and IDTest2.png (did you update the
headers correctly in the source files?).

The image file MUST be in PNG (standard Portable Network Graphics)
format!

Different OSes have a history of mucking with screenshots and file
formats, so ENSURE that your screenshot is actually a standard
Portable Network Graphics file and not some other format.  If your
screenshot is not in standard Portable Network Graphics format,
you get ZERO credit for it, so be careful!

Do NOT include any other files in the directory.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:
  1. Ensure your program compiles and runs correctly.  You should
     not get ANY warnings or errors when you compile.  ALWAYS
     compile your code with -Wall and -Wextra and deal with ANY
     warnings or errors that are identified.  ALWAYS compile your
     code with -fsanitize=leak and -fsanitize=address and deal
     with ANY warnings or errors reported.

     Generating warnings or errors, not compiling, not running,
     core dumping, crashing, going into an infinite loop, getting
     the wrong answers, getting memory errors ... will earn you
     ZERO points.

     Ensure your test results match those given in the Results/
     subdirectory.  Not matching EXACTLY means you are not
     performing the transformations correctly.  You will not get
     any credit for malfunctioning transforms.

     ('EXACTLY' means character-by-character the same in the
      output.  No differences in values.)

  2. Ensure that you update the three header lines in the source
     files with YOUR name (family name first, then a comma, then
     your personal name), YOUR NetID, and the date you edit the
     file, in the format YYYY-MM-DD (all digits!).

     Not updating the header lines properly will cost you points.

  3. Ensure your submission is packaged EXACTLY as described above.

      -- Your submission should be a ZIP FILE (not a tar, rar, gz,
         or any other kind of compressed file).

      -- The zip file should be named 'hmwk_02_abc1234.zip' (with
         'abc1234' replaced with YOUR NetID).

      -- This zip file should have ONE item in it, a directory
         named 'hmwk_02_abc1234'  (with 'abc1234' replaced with
         YOUR NetID).

      -- Your files should be in that directory.  The files should
         be named transforms.c, IDTest2.c, and IDTest2.png.

     Submissions in the wrong format score ZERO points.

  4. Your transforms.c is going to be tried against another test
     file when it's evaluated for credit.  You DEFINITELY need to
     make some test cases of your own to ensure that your
     transforms are working properly.

  5. After you submit your zip file on Canvas, download it from
     Canvas into an empty directory, unzip it, and check that your
     submission is in the proper format, that the program runs and
     prints the correct output, that you updated the header lines
     correctly, that your screenshot really is in standard
     Portable Network Graphics format, that there are only three
     files in the directory, and so forth.

  6. Are you CERTAIN you complied with all of these nit-picking
     instructions?  Really?  Maybe you ought to check just one
     more time. :)
