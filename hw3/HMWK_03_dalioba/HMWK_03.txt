Programming Assignment 03

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:

  * Demonstrate ability to make simple edits to and run the
      Display tool.

  * Demonstrate once again the ability to take a screenshot
      properly.  (No, really;  for some persons, this really does
      seem to be harder than it sounds. :)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Background:

  * Get the Display tool from the Tools section of the Modules
      area on Canvas.  Unzip it someplace convenient, read the
      handy README.txt file, and try out the program.  You must
      run the program with Python3!

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

  1. Download hmwk_03_dalioba.zip from Canvas.

  2. Unzip this file somewhere convenient.

  3. Change 'dalioba' in the name of the directory to your NetID.
     (Your NetID is three letters followed by four or five digits.
      The directory name will now be something like
      'hmwk_03_abc1234' but with _your_ NetID in place of
      'abc1234'.)

  4. Look in that directory.  Surprise!  All that's there is this
      HMWK_03.txt file.  All of the rest of the files are in that
      Display.zip that was explained in the Background section
      above.

  5. Edit the myGraphics.py file:

      Line 37 :  Change the color of the background to be
        something other than grey.  The format of the color is the
        standard #rrggbb style where rr, gg, and bb are two-digit
        hex values representing the strength of the Red, Green,
        and Blue components of the color.  Line 37 should now look
        something like this:

      world.rootWindow, width=1, height=1, bg='#C0C0C0' )

        except the '#C0C0C0' should be replaced with YOUR color.
        (Pick a color combination that's NOT any shade of grey!)

        Ensure that your color is light enough that the lines
        drawn on it are clearly visible.  Those lines are drawn in
        black, so don't make your background color too dark.

      Line 109 :  Change 'dalioba' in the message to be YOUR
        NetID.  (Remember, your NetID is three letters followed by
        four or five digits.)  Line 109 should now look something
        like this:

    msg = f'abc1234: {formatStr % args}'

        except that the 'abc1234' should be replaced with YOUR
        NetID.

  6. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you do NOT change anything else in
      this file.  Do not disturb the spacing;  Python is sensitive
      to spaces on the fronts of lines (that's how it determines
      nesting level), so don't mess with the spacing.

  7. Once you have made your two changes, rerun main.py, load the
      given test.sdf file, and take a screenshot.  The screenshot
      should look like the test_screenshot.png file, but with a
      different background color (NOT any shade of grey) and with
      YOUR NetID appearing in the message in the status bar.

      The screenshot MUST be in PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
      format.

      Name your screenshot hmwk_03.png.

      By the way, all you need is a screenshot of the program
      window itself, not your entire desktop.  What you choose to
      have on your desktop is your own business, not mine.  By
      clipping the image to be just the program window, you keep
      the rest of the desktop private.  =:O

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Make a zipfile of your 'hmwk_03_abc1234' directory (with 'abc1234'
changed to YOUR NetID and with your hmwk_03.png file in it) and
submit this zipfile on Canvas as your results for this assignment.

All your zipfile should include is a directory with one file in
it, hmwk_03.png.

The image file MUST be in PNG (standard Portable Network Graphics)
format!

Different OSes have a history of mucking with screenshots and file
formats, so ENSURE that your screenshot is actually a standard
Portable Network Graphics file and not some other format.  If your
screenshot is not in standard Portable Network Graphics format,
you get ZERO credit for it, so be careful!

Do NOT include any other files in the directory when you zip it.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:
  1. Ensure your submission is packaged EXACTLY as described above.

      -- Your submission should be a ZIP FILE (not a tar, rar, gz,
         or any other kind of compressed file).

      -- The zip file should be named 'hmwk_03_abc1234.zip' (with
         'abc1234' replaced with YOUR NetID).

      -- This zip file should have ONE item in it, a directory
         named 'hmwk_03_abc1234'  (with 'abc1234' replaced with
         YOUR NetID).

      -- Your file should be in that directory.  The file should
         be named hmwk_03.png.

     Submissions in the wrong format score ZERO points.

  2. After you submit your zip file on Canvas, download it from
     Canvas into an empty directory, unzip it, and check that your
     submission is in the proper format, that your screenshot
     really is in standard Portable Network Graphics format, that
     it's an image of the program window only (not your complete
     desktop), that there is only one file in the directory, and
     so forth.

  3. Are you CERTAIN you complied with all of these nit-picking
     instructions?  Really?  Maybe you ought to check just one
     more time. :)
